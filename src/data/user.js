			"My name is Mohamed Yusuf, but you probably figured that out already. I wear many hats - I'm a computer scientist, teaching assistant, barista, web developer, penetration tester, CEO and a coffee addict (not necessarily in that order). Through this website, I aim to showcase my prowess in software engineering and penetration testing, featuring both my personal and professional escapades. Worry not, You're not sifting through a half-century-old portfolio of someone who once reveled in the limelight! I plan to keep this website as fresh as my daily espresso shots. So dive in and enjoy the blend of technology and caffein induced creativity!",
